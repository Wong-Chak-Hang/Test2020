# Portfolio Page

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/F5B_Sunny_25/pen/poQPBxB](https://codepen.io/F5B_Sunny_25/pen/poQPBxB).

Bootstrap landing page demo site. All images taken by me in Ubud, Bali 2018.

Page contains responsive navbar and some simple, clean animations drawing users to the buttons on screen. Buttons show modals, which may be a bit overkill, but are good for conveying information quickly.  I put in a carousel in the aboutme modal to show that Bootstrap elements nest well inside each other. 

I added an animation that pops up the headers of my about me section when they come into view to keep viewers engaged.
