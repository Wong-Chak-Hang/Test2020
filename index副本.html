		<p>Hello, my name is Sunny, I come from an ordinary family of five in Macau.  My future university goal is to study medicine.  I believe in the power of medicine to change people's lives and contribute to society.  Besides my love of medicine, I also have a strong interest in sports and singing.  In my spare time, I will sign up for singing classes and play basketball, which can not only strengthen my body, but also allow me to discover my potential and add value to myself.

    In life, I am always willing to help others, and I also like to communicate with others.  I firmly believe that through my own efforts and continuous learning, I will be able to realize my dream.  Looking forward to future challenges and achievements, and looking forward to growing and making progress together with you.  I believe that diverse interests and attempts can not only enrich my life, but also help my life grow.  In my future university study and life, I look forward to discovering more interests and potentials.

<p>
	As a student of Colégio Diocesano de São José (5ª), I participated in the school's spare time activities and learned a lot about sports, Chinese chess, yoga, etc.  For example, gymnastics classes and yoga classes on mats taught me to have a stable mind, and chess taught me to learn to take every step steadily.
	</p>
	<p>
In addition, in the school's subject group activities, I also learned a lot of soft skills. As a team leader, how to make the team more united and assign everyone's work well.  As a team member, try to cooperate with the command of the team leader, do your own thing well, and activate the atmosphere in the team.
		In extracurricular activities, I participated in the first aid course of the Red Cross, learned how to deal with emergencies and the correct handling techniques, and laid a solid foundation for the subjects I will study in the university in the future
	<br>
I am comfortable with HTML/CSS, CSS animations, JavaScript, Node, Express, mySQL, Bootstrap, SemanticUI, and Adobe Photoshop.  
				</p>
				<h1 class="highlight">Experience</h1><div class="addBorderBottom"></div>
<p>
I used to clean the streets in Macau Flying Eagle Project, go to nursing homes to help the elderly, and do some social service industries.
			</p>
			<p>
In my learning journey, I found many interesting methods. For example, I can divide the tasks of the day into two major tasks and three small tasks, or five medium tasks and four small tasks, because learning must be divided  When you have a good time, you will be more efficient in doing things.  in addition.  Human memory is the best within an hour after waking up, and the mind is also very clear, so I will choose to memorize some English vocabulary, or do some math exercises.  And you don't need to study hard because trying will only make you work really hard.  The most important thing is to let yourself love learning, so that it will not be strenuous and inefficient.	
			</p>
 Sports: I participated in the school skipping team in middle school.  The first year, I didn't know what to do, what to practice.  After the second and third years, I became more involved in the rope skipping team, and played the results of my own practice, and won some medals with my ability.  In addition, I am very glad that skipping has brought me a healthy body, so that I am no longer as obese as a primary school student, and it also makes my personality more cheerful, and I am no longer so taciturn.

	<h1>Why?</h1>
	<p>
	Because I think being a veterinarian can help people too, and I grew up loving animals.  My animals are dogs, cats, turtles, goldfish.  So I figured I wouldn't be afraid of animals and be up to the job.
